# emojinality

> An emoji-combinator to represent the user's personality

<!-- Briefly describe the project, what it's used for, and how does life get awesome when someone starts to use it. -->

This repository showcases continued creative enhancements to the [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend) *your-personality-in-emojis* project, while additionally highlighting development of my overall professional practice and expertise.

Scrimba provides a fantastic platform for coding as you learn along with video lessons. But since their coding environment is presented anew in each lesson,  enhancements to this project (which we are encouraged to continue sharing in the course community discussion) required selecting and revisiting a single lesson to work within. Rather than manage that ongoing work in isolation, apart from my preferred systematic approach to projects, I ported my codebase into Github for persistent access to local development with version control and a hosted project site.

Beyond its many resources for tracking changes in my code, I saw double-opportunity in Github and a Github hosted project site. Creating efficiencies in my development process allows me to focus on creative solutions, while at the same time exercising my organizational and documentation abilities helps advance a unified understanding that leads to *genuinely* achieving project goals and ultimately exponential growth.
